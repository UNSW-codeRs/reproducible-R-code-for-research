## Reproducible research


> Research is reproducible when others can reproduce the results of a scientific study given only the original data, code, and documentation 
([Alston & Rick 2021](https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1801))

## Reproducible code

#### Expectations: 

> Can be run by **any user** with **any data** and in **any computer/environment**.

--

#### More realistic: 

> Can be run by **a target user** with **well formatted data** and in **any reasonable computer/environment** by following **well documented instructions**.

--

#### More important: 

> It helps to be **more efficient** and **mitigate common problems** in research (and your research life...)

### Research lifecycle

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", out.height="60%"}
grViz("../figs/research-life-cycle.dot")
```
</center>


---

### This usually means: 

.pull-left[

*You* will probably need to (re-)run *your* code each time...

- your data changes:
  - new experiments/field work,
  - error fixes
- your analysis changes:
  - new questions, hypothesis?
  - reviewer feedback
- your outputs change, e.g.:
  - request from journal editors,
  - figures for presentations vs. publication
]

.pull-right[
> **You** want your code to:
>
> - work with [new / modified data](#newdata)
> 
> - be modular and flexible  (add or change single steps)
>
> - be customizable (new colors, new plots, etc)
]

---

### Bonus benefits:

Your reproducible code will help **other user** to run the analysis again: 

- with your data (or sample datasets) to verify it works

- with their own data 

- with available data from another source

Can you ***take your code anywhere*** you want?

]
---

### Portability means:

.pull-left[
*You* probably need to run *your* code:

- at home and in the office (Laptop vs. Desktop)

- remotely: in the Cloud or a HPC

- after any hardware and software upgrades

]

.pull-right[

> **You** want to document how your code:
>
> - works with specific operating systems + sofware versions
> 
> - can be adapted to other OS + software versions
>
> - can be used as a template for alternative solutions 

]

---

### Bonus benefits:

Your reproducible and portable code will help **other user** to run the analysis again: 

- In completely different OS

- Different hardware configurations

- Different software combinations (older or newer versions)
