# R code for reproducible research

The first version of this repository was created for Skills seminar at the Centre for Ecosystem Science in UNSW, presented in March 2023.

This repository contains:

-   a [presentation](presentation/presentation.html) about the benefits of reproducible research for the author of the research,
-   a list of simple recommendations in different formats:
    -   [a Markdown file with general recommendations](documentation/general-recommendations.md),
    -   [an Rmarkdown file with more specific recommendations](documentation/specific-recommendations.Rmd),
    -   a couple of commented R scripts in the [Rscripts](Rscripts/01-data-download.R) folder for a short excercise on reproducibility of code
-   Miscellaneous files related to the `Rproject`, `git` and the `renv` packages and a couple of figures in graphviz (`.dot`) format in folder [figs](figs/)
